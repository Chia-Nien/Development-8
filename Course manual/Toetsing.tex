\section{Assessment}
The course is tested with two exams: a written exam and a practical exam. Both parts happen exclusively on paper and must be sufficient in order to pass the course.


\subsection{Theoretical examination \modulecode}
The general shape of an exam for \texttt{\modulecode} is made up of a short series of highly structured open questions.
In each exam the content of the questions will change, but the structure of the questions will remain the same. Questions might include (but not limited to): apply the semantics of lambda calculus on a small function, determine the type of a functional program, determine the result of the execution of a functional program. A sample exam will be provided during the course.

\subsection{Practical examination \modulecode}
The practical exam requires to implement a series of functions in the language F\# described in the exam text.
